# The-Life-Game-
The Life Game is a simulation game developed by mathematician Conway John As a research model
The life cycle of the organic living entrepreneur. The game is played on a huge matrix whose members are sites
Possible livelihood (existence): Each site can have one of the following two modes:
A. "There is life" - a full living site - is marked as a full square
B. "There is no life" - an empty living site - is marked as an empty square 
CONWAY BASIC GENETICS RULES:
Birth - In any site where there is "no life" exactly 3 living neighbors, there will be a birth in the next generation. Other
The site remains "lifeless" - empty.
2. Death - In any site where "there is life" has 0 or 1 living neighbors death will occur in the next generation as a result
From loneliness. In any site where "there is life" and even 4 living neighbors or more, death will occur in the next generation
As a result of a "population explosion".
3. Existence - Any site where "there is life" and has 2 or 3 living neighbors, will continue to exist in a generation
the next.
The processes of birth, death and existence occur simultaneously in all the sites and create a new state of life called
New generation.
